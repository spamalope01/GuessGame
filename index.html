    <h1>Jonathan Daniel</h1>
    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>I'm originally from Alabama.  Born and raised in Birmingham, I've spent the last 10 years as a software business analyst, writing requirements that dictate how software should look and function.  After so long of doing that, I've realized I need something more, I need something stable.  I need....a career.  And since organizing ferret fights in alleys isn't paying as well as it used to, I'm moving forward with this.</p>
